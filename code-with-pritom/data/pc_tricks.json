    "content_html": "<p>Mastering the Linux terminal can significantly enhance your productivity. Two indispensable tools for system monitoring are <code>htop</code> and <code>ncdu</code>.</p><h4>htop - Interactive Process Viewer</h4><p><code>htop</code> is an interactive system-monitor process-viewer and process-manager. It provides a dynamic real-time view of a running system. Compared to the traditional <code>top</code> command, <code>htop</code> offers a more user-friendly interface, color-coded displays, and the ability to scroll vertically and horizontally and interact with processes (e.g., kill, renice) using keyboard shortcuts.</p><p><strong>Installation (Debian/Ubuntu):</strong> <code>sudo apt update && sudo apt install htop</code></p><p><strong>Usage:</strong> Simply type <code>htop</code> in your terminal.</p><h4>ncdu - NCurses Disk Usage</h4><p><code>ncdu</code> (NCurses Disk Usage) is a disk usage analyzer with an ncurses interface. It's designed to find space-hogging files and directories on a server or your local machine. After scanning a directory, it presents a navigable list of files and folders sorted by size, making it easy to identify what's consuming your disk space.</p><p><strong>Installation (Debian/Ubuntu):</strong> <code>sudo apt update && sudo apt install ncdu</code></p><p><strong>Usage:</strong> Navigate to the directory you want to analyze (e.g., <code>cd /var</code>) and run <code>ncdu</code>. Use arrow keys to navigate and 'd' to delete selected items (use with caution!).</p>",

    "content_html": "<p>A slow browser can be a major drag on productivity. Here are some common culprits and how to address them:</p><ul><li><strong>Clear Cache and Cookies:</strong> Over time, cached data and cookies can accumulate and slow things down. Regularly clear them through your browser's settings (History > Clear browsing data).</li><li><strong>Disable Unused Extensions:</strong> Browser extensions can add useful functionality, but too many active ones can consume resources. Disable or remove extensions you no longer use.</li><li><strong>Update Your Browser:</strong> Ensure your browser is always updated to the latest version. Updates often include performance improvements and security patches.</li><li><strong>Manage Tabs:</strong> Having dozens of tabs open simultaneously can strain your system's memory. Use tab management extensions or make it a habit to close unneeded tabs.</li><li><strong>Check for Malware:</strong> Malware can significantly impact browser performance. Run a scan with a reputable antivirus/antimalware tool.</li><li><strong>Reset Browser Settings (Last Resort):</strong> If all else fails, you can try resetting your browser to its default settings. This will typically disable extensions, clear temporary data, but keep your bookmarks and passwords.</li></ul>",
